#CSS Code Explanation 
**overflow** - sets the desired behavior when content does not fit in the parent element box (overflows) in the horizontal and/or vertical direction. <br/> 
<pre>  **Hidden**-Overflow content is clipped at the element's padding box. There are no scroll bars, and the clipped content is not visible (i.e., clipped content is hidden), but the content still exists. User agents do not add scroll bars and also do not allow users to view the content outside the clipped. <br/>
