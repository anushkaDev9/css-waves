 # CSS Code Explanation
**overflow** - sets the desired behavior when content does not fit in the parent element box (overflows) in the horizontal and/or vertical direction. <br/> 
  **Hidden**-Overflow content is clipped at the element's padding box. There are no scroll bars, and the clipped content is not visible (i.e., clipped content is hidden), but the content still exists. User agents do not add scroll bars and also do not allow users to view the content outside the clipped. <br/>
**cubic-bezier** - we can use the animation-timing-function property. This property allows us to specify how the animation should progress over time.we can use the cubic-bezier() function. This function takes four arguments, which specify the four control points of the curve.<br/>
**nth-of-type(2)** -The CSS pseudo-class nth-of-type(2) selects all elements of the same type (tag name) that are the second child of their parent.
